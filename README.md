How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Built out website according to the client's needs and also based on my own suggestions for inclusion based on research and then continued to evolve and tweak it based on ongoing input to adapt initial version to ensure client's vision was realized and business needs were met.


Optimizations

Streamlined the design of the website after taking primary device and importance of users' connection speeds into consideration in design of website alongside considerations such as content and JavaScript features desired. (primarily due to speed of users' connections and limitations due to physical geography imposing spotty or poor coverage)


Lessons Learned:
The importance of communicating with clients to adapt their vision in more realistic ways due to practical concerns. (client initially wanted a lot of content and features implemented on the landing page, but those concerns had to be tempered)
