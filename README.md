How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Built out website according to the client's needs and also based on my own suggestions for inclusion based on research and then continued to evolve and tweak it based on ongoing input to adapt initial version to ensure client's vision was realized and business needs were met.


Optimizations

Took low bandwidth into consideration in design of website and JavaScript features desired due to speed of users' connections and limitations due to physical geography. (presuming a potential influence in addition to low connection speeds).
(optional)

Lessons Learned:
The importance of communicating with clients to adapt their vision in more realistic ways due to practical concerns.
